                    <p>At VisualVaastu, we believe that every structure is more than bricks and blueprints — it is a living space of energy, emotion, and intention.</p>

                    <p>Founded by Dr. Komal Jeetu Parmar and Pooja Palesha Rathod in 2010, VisualVaastu was born from a shared vision — to make Vastu Shastra simple, practical, and positively life-changing for everyone.</p>

                    <p>Our purpose is to bridge the wisdom of ancient Vastu science with modern architectural understanding, creating spaces that reflect peace, purpose, and prosperity.</p>

                        We don&apos;t just correct spaces — we align energy to support growth, stability, and well-being.
